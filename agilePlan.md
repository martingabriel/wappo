## Agile plan:

## Sprint 1: Idea Planning

- **Duration:** 1 week
- Objectives:
  - Define the game concept and mechanics
  - Create a detailed game design document (GDD)
  - Outline core features and user stories
  - Set up project repository and version control
  - Establish development workflow and tools

## Sprint 2: Working Prototype without Graphics

- **Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Objectives:**
  1. Working Level Loading
     - Implement a system for loading levels from predefined data structures
     - Create a basic level editor or level data format
  2. Working Movements of Player and Computer Enemy

     - Implement basic enemy AI (movement patterns, simple decision making)
  3. Working Collisions
     - Implement collision detection for player, enemies, and environment
     - Ensure smooth interaction between game objects
- **Tasks:**
  - Set up initial Godot project and configure basic settings
  - Create basic player and enemy objects with placeholder sprites
  - Implement level loading functionality
  - Develop player movement mechanics
  - Implement basic enemy AI and movement
  - Integrate collision detection and response

## Sprint 3: Add Graphics, Sounds, and Animations

- **Duration:** 3 weeks
- **Objectives:**
  - Replace placeholder graphics with final or interim assets
  - Add character and environment animations
  - Integrate sound effects and background music
- **Tasks:**
  - Import and set up graphical assets for characters, enemies, and environments
  - Create and implement animations for player, enemies, and interactive objects
  - Add sound effects for movements, collisions, and other actions
  - Implement background music and ambient sounds

## Sprint 4: Add Game Over and Next Level Loading

- **Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Objectives:**
  1. Add 9 Demo Levels
     - Design and implement 9 demo levels showcasing different mechanics and challenges
  2. Game Over and Level Transition Mechanics
     - Implement game over conditions and screen
     - Create a system for loading the next level upon completion of the current level
- **Tasks:**
  - Design and implement 9 unique demo levels
  - Implement game over screen with retry options
  - Create level transition system for progressing to the next level

## Sprint 5: Add Sounds and Splash Screen

- **Duration:** 1 week
- **Objectives:**
  - Add additional sound effects to enhance game experience
  - Create and implement a splash screen for game startup
- **Tasks:**
  - Identify and integrate additional sound effects (e.g., menu navigation, level start/completion)
  - Design and implement a splash screen with game logo and animations
  - Ensure all sound assets are balanced and integrated seamlessly

## Summary Timeline

- **Sprint 1:** 1 week
- **Sprint 2:** 2 weeks
- **Sprint 3:** 3 weeks
- **Sprint 4:** 2 weeks
- **Sprint 5:** 1 week

Total duration: 9 weeks
